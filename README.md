This is basic workshop for processing Next-generation sequencing reads from illumina platform for population genetics analysis. We are demonstrating analysis pipeline for whole genome resequencing data using subsets of  whole genome resequencing datasets. RADseq data maybe analysed similarly if a reference genomes exists.

It is a pre-requiste for the workshop to install some form of linux/shell terminal for example those using windows may try mobaxterm (https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net), mac and linux systems should have a terminal already.

You may want to learn quickly about how illuminating sequencing works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8&t=238s
