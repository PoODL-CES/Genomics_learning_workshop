    "# 🌱 Genomics Learning Workshop — NGS Analysis Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on workshop introduces students to the basic analysis pipeline for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) reads, focusing on Illumina whole genome resequencing (WGS) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same workflow can be adapted to RAD-seq, GBS, or amplicon-seq as long as a reference genome is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 By the end of this workshop, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Work with raw FASTQ sequencing files\n",
    "- Perform quality control and adapter trimming\n",
    "- Map reads to a reference genome and generate sorted BAM files\n",
    "- Call SNP and indel variants\n",
    "- Apply variant filtering to obtain high-confidence SNP datasets\n",
    "- Perform population genetics analyses such as PCA and ADMIXTURE\n",
