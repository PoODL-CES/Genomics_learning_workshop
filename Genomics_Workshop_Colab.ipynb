    "# 🌱 Genomics Learning Workshop — NGS Analysis Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on workshop is designed to introduce students to the basic analysis pipeline for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) reads, specifically using data generated on the Illumina platform for population genetics applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on whole genome resequencing (WGS) data, although the same workflow can also be applied to RAD-seq, GBS, or amplicon sequencing datasets—with only minor adjustments—provided that a suitable reference genome is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 🎯 By the end of this workshop, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work with raw sequencing reads (FASTQ files)\n",
    "- Perform quality control and preprocessing (including adapter trimming)\n",
    "- Map reads to a reference genome and generate sorted BAM files\n",
    "- Call genetic variants (SNPs and indels)\n",
    "- Apply variant filtering steps to obtain high-confidence SNP datasets\n",
    "- Perform population genetics analyses such as PCA and ADMIXTURE\n",
    "\n",
