### What are FASTQ files and how they different form FASTA file ?
## Fastq files are the sequencing output files files obtained after demultimplexing (sorting or separating sequencing reads based on their unique barcodes or indices) data from illumina seqeuncers. Most sequencing companies provide this file format for illumina data.
## Structure of fastq files

## ASCII-(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) define Phred Quality Score (Q score) corresponding to each base in the sequence.
## Phred Quality Score (Q score)=âˆ’10log10(P), The Phred quality score is a measure used to indicate the accuracy of a base call in DNA sequencing.
## ASSCII & corrosponding score-https://www.ascii-code.com/

### Processsing of the Fastq files 
#	Remove low-quality reads -fastqc
# Trim adapters -trimgalore
# Assess Base Quality-fastqc

### For fastq files use zonedo link-https://zenodo.org/records/14258052

wget link of the file 

# Downloaded file will look like this 'BEN_CI18_sub_1.fq.gz?download=1'. Change the name of the file by running this below commamnd. The final file would be look like this BEN_CI18_sub_1_fastqc.zip

for file in *\?download=1; do
    newname=$(echo "$file" | sed "s/?download=1//")
    mv "$file" "$newname"
done

### Install conda (https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/) (conda-is a package management software & environment, It will help to create different environment for variety of tools )

mkdir -p ~/miniconda3 
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh

## This command will create a directry name as miniconda and then it will download the miniconda installer script and it will removes the installer script after installation.

## After installing, close and reopen your terminal application or refresh it by running the following command:
source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate

## To initialize conda on all available shells, run the following command:
miniconda3/bin/./conda init --all

### Install fastqc
conda create -n fastqc -c bioconda fastqc
#conda create: creats a new conda environment. Conda environments are isolated environments that allows to manage dependencies and packages for specific projects without affecting the global setup.
#-n: short for --name. (here it would be fastqc).
#-c: specifices the channel used to download packages (here we are getting fastqc packages in the bioconda channel).
#fastqc: name of the package or the tool we are installing in the new environment. Used for quality control of sequencing data.

## Activate the conda environment
conda activate fastqc
