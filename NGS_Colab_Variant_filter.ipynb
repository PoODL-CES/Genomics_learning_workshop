        "###Introduction to Variant Filtering\n",
        "\n",
        "High-throughput sequencing technologies generate millions of genetic variants across genomes, but not all detected variants are biologically meaningful or technically reliable. Raw variant calls often contain sequencing errors, low-confidence genotypes, and missing data that can severely bias downstream analyses. From removing errors to retain only high-confidence SNPs, each step here helps you build a more accurate dataset for further applications such as population genetics.\n",
        "Below are the details of the filters that we are going to use during this analysis to get a filtered VCF file.\n",
        "\n",
        "1: *passOnly*-  Retained only variant sites that passed all internal quality filter performed by the variant caller (Strelka in this case). During variant calling, Strelka assigns a PASS or FAIL tag to each variant based on multiple internal metrics such as base quality, mapping quality, strand bias, and read position bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "2: *biallelicOnly*- Kept only biallelic variants (i.e., sites with exactly two alleles) for downstream compatibility and clarity. Because most population genetic software assumes biallelic markers, this filter ensures mathematical simplicity, software compatibility, and interpretability.\n",
        "\n",
        "3: *rmvIndels*- Removed insertions and deletions (INDELs), keeping only SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms). Indels have higher sequencing and alignment error rates than SNPs. Removing indels ensures that the dataset is composed of high-confidence point mutations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4: *minMAF0Pt05*- Retained only variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.05, meaning the alternate allele must be present in at least 5% of individuals. As very rare variants (MAF < 5%) are more likely to be sequencing errors, they are often poorly powered in statistical tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "5: *chr_E2*- Restricted to a specific chromosome/region of interest (e.g., chr_E2). This enables targeted analysis of specific genomic regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6: *minDP3*- Required a minimum depth (DP) of 3 per genotype to avoid false positives due to low coverage. Because low-depth genotypes are highly error-prone and vulnerable to random sequencing noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "7: *minQ30*- Ensured that each site has a minimum site quality score of 30, reflecting high confidence in the variant.  This improves accuracy of allele frequency estimates and reliability of genome-wide scans.\n",
        "\n",
        "8: *minGQ30*- Filtered genotypes to retain only those with a Genotype Quality (GQ) ≥ 30, removing uncertain genotype calls. This helps prevent the misclassification of homozygous vs heterozygous states.\n",
        "\n",
        "9: *hwe_0.05*- Removed variants deviating significantly from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (p < 0.05), which could indicate genotyping errors or population substructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "10: *imiss_0.6*- Filtered out individuals with >60% missing genotypes to maintain data quality. Highly incomplete samples can distort PCA and admixture results.\n",
        "\n",
        "11: *miss_0.6*- Removed variants missing in >60% of individuals. This ensures each retained SNP is well represented across individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "12: *mid95percentile* - Likely indicates the removal of extreme outliers in genotype depth or quality, retaining the middle 95% of the data. This removes the Lowest 2.5% of undercovered, unreliable sites and the highest 2.5% of multi-mapped, repetitive, or duplicated regions.\n",
