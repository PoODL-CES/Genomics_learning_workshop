### Variant calling using strelka
conda create -n strelka -c bioconda strelka
#creates a new Conda environment named strelka and installs Strelka2 from the bioconda channel.

conda activate strelka
#Activates strelka

which configureStrelkaGermlineWorkflow.py
#If Strelka2 is installed properly, this command should return the full path

/home/your_username/miniconda3/envs/strelka/bin/configureStrelkaGermlineWorkflow.py --bam name_of_the_file_aligned_reads_sorted_deduplicated.bam --referenceFasta reference_genome_filename.fna --runDir strelka_germline
#/home/your_username/miniconda3/envs/strelka/bin/configureStrelkaGermlineWorkflow.py: This is the Strelka configuration script used for germline variant calling. It prepares the pipeline and generates the necessary files to run the variant calling workflow.
# --bam name_of_the_file_aligned_reads_sorted_deduplicated.bam: Specifies the input BAM file (aligned, sorted, and deduplicated reads). This is the sequencing data from which germline variants will be called.
#  --referenceFasta reference_genome_filename.fna Provides the reference genome in FASTA format. This is the genome against which the BAM file was aligned.
#--runDir strelka_germline: Specifies the output directory where the workflow will be set up. Inside this directory, Strelka will create scripts and configuration files needed to run the variant calling pipeline.

strelka_germline/runWorkflow.py -m local -j 8
#strelka_germline/runWorkflow.py: This script was generated during the configureStrelkaGermlineWorkflow.py step. It is the main script that runs the variant calling process.
#-m local: Specifies that the workflow will be executed on the local machine.
#-j 8: Defines the number of parallel threads (CPUs) to use.
